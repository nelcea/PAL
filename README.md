PAL is the generic project for my research in the world of Wearable AI.

In a first phase, I catalogued the main projects currently underway at [Pinboard - Wearable AI projects](https://www.ericbariaux.com/pinboard/).

I intend to test as many of them as possible, learning what works or not and distill the ideas that most align with what I'm trying to achieve in this project.

In a first instance, I approach this as part of my PKM / BASB exploration.

Some key aspects I'd like to take into account:
- privacy, running as much as possible locally
- disconnected, should be able to use as many features as possible without an internet connection

I'm currently working on a prototype iOS application that uses [Friend](https://github.com/BasedHardware/Friend) hardware and does the transcription locally on the iPhone. I will publish the code for this as soon as I have something working.
